Next.js BMI Calculator

## Project Overview

This BMI Calculator is a web application developed as a beginner project to explore and understand the core concepts of Next.js, a powerful React framework. It's designed to provide a practical experience in building and styling a simple, user-friendly interface.

## Features and Functionality

BMI Calculation: Users can input their height and weight to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI), a widely used metric to categorize weight status.

Unit Flexibility: The calculator allows users to choose between metric (kg and cm) and imperial (lbs, feet, and inches) units, catering to a global audience.

Responsive Design: Crafted with responsiveness in mind, the application adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.

## Technology Stack

Next.js: Leveraged for its server-side and client-side rendering capabilities, which enhance the performance and SEO friendliness of the application.

React: Used for building the user interface with components, enabling a modular and scalable structure.

Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI: These tools bring efficiency and aesthetic appeal to the application's design, allowing for rapid styling with a focus on utility-first principles.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Next.js and its integration with React, understanding how to manage state, handle user input, and render components dynamically. Working with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI provided valuable insights into modern CSS frameworks and design systems. This project served as a practical application of fundamental web development concepts in a real-world scenario.
